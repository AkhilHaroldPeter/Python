# BLACKJACK
The goal is to assemble a hand with a total value surpassing that of the dealer's without exceeding 21. Cards with face values of Kings, Queens, Jacks, and Tens are assigned a value of 10 each. An Ace holds a value of either 1 or 11. All other cards retain their face values in the counting process.
