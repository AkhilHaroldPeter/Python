## Description

The Password Generator is a Python script that generates strong and secure passwords based on user-defined criteria. It utilizes the `random`, `string`, `text2art`, and `sys` packages to create unique and complex passwords.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following Python packages:

- `random`: Used for generating random numbers.
- `string`: Used for generating random strings.
- `text2art`: Used to create ASCII art for visual appeal.
- `sys`: Used for interacting with the system environment.

## Package Installation

To install the required packages, use the following `pip` commands:
```pip install text2art```



## Installation

To use the Password Generator, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

## Python Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. If you haven't installed Python yet, follow these steps:

### Windows

1. Download Python installer from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Run the installer, ensuring that the option to add Python to your PATH is selected.
3. Follow the installation steps, and Python will be installed on your system.

### macOS

1. macOS usually comes with Python pre-installed. To check if Python is installed, open the Terminal and type `python3 --version`. If Python is installed, it will display the version number.
2. If Python is not installed, you can install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Open Terminal and run the following command:
`brew install python@3.9`

### Linux

1. Python is often installed by default on Linux systems. To check if Python is installed, open a terminal and type `python3 --version`. If Python is installed, it will display the version number.
2. If Python is not installed, you can install it using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use `apt`:
`sudo apt update`
`sudo apt install python3`


## After you have installed python you can run the code by following the below steps:
- Clone the repository to your local machine: https://github.com/AkhilHaroldPeter/Python.git (If this is your first time doing this, please follow through the following documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
- Navigate to the directory containing the Password_Generator files.
- Install the required packages using pip.
- Run the `Project3-Password_Generator.py` script.
- Please follow the prompts to utilize the application and select your desired options for generating passwords.
#### Alternatively, you can download the repository as a zip file, unzip it, and then use it on your local machine.


## Key Concepts

- Random Number Generation: Utilized the `random` module to generate random numbers, ensuring the unpredictability of generated passwords.
- String Manipulation: Employed string manipulation techniques to construct passwords by concatenating characters and symbols.
- User Input Handling: Implemented mechanisms to handle user input for specifying password length and selecting character sets, ensuring user-friendly interaction.
- Secure Password Generation: Implemented methods to ensure the generated passwords meet security standards by incorporating a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- Dependency Management: Utilized the `pip` package manager to install and manage external dependencies such as `text2art` for ASCII art generation, enhancing the user experience.
