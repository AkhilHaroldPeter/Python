## Python Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. If you haven't installed Python yet, follow these steps:

### Windows

1. Download Python installer from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Run the installer, ensuring that the option to add Python to your PATH is selected.
3. Follow the installation steps, and Python will be installed on your system.

### macOS

1. macOS usually comes with Python pre-installed. To check if Python is installed, open the Terminal and type `python3 --version`. If Python is installed, it will display the version number.
2. If Python is not installed, you can install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Open Terminal and run the following command:
`brew install python@3.9`

### Linux

1. Python is often installed by default on Linux systems. To check if Python is installed, open a terminal and type `python3 --version`. If Python is installed, it will display the version number.
2. If Python is not installed, you can install it using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use `apt`:
`sudo apt update`
`sudo apt install python3`


## After you have installed python you can run the code by following the below steps:
- Clone the repository to your local machine: https://github.com/AkhilHaroldPeter/Python.git (If this is your first time doing this, please follow through the following documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
- Navigate to the directory containing the Calculator files.
- Install the required packages using pip.
- Run the `Project6-Calculator.py` script.
#### Alternatively, you can download the repository as a zip file, unzip it, and then use it on your local machine.

## Key Concepts

1. **Arithmetic Operations**: Implementing various arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation to perform calculations.

2. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Utilizing a command-line interface to provide a user-friendly interaction for inputting numbers and selecting operations.

3. **Error Handling**: Implementing error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle invalid inputs, prevent program crashes, and provide informative error messages to the user.

4. **External Libraries**: Leveraging external libraries such as `text2art` to enhance the visual presentation of the calculator application and provide additional features if needed.

5. **System-Level Operations**: Utilizing system-level operations provided by the `sys` library for platform compatibility and functionality, ensuring the calculator works seamlessly across different environments.

These key concepts encompass the fundamental elements of the calculator project, including its functionality, user interaction, error handling, integration with external libraries, and system compatibility. They form the basis for understanding the implementation and design choices made within the calculator application.
